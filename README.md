# PS_Portfolio

This is my Portfolio website which I made while learning full stack development using MERN stack.

MERN Stack:

M - MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database.
E - Express.js: A back-end web application framework for Node.js.
R - React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
N - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows for server-side scripting.

MongoDB isn't implemented yet but there are plans for implementing it in near future.

Its deployed using Render.
